üõ†Ô∏è Service Desk Application Overview
This project is a comprehensive Service Desk Application built during my internship. The platform enables users to create accounts, sign in, and submit service requests or report issues. Administrators are able to oversee these tickets by assigning, monitoring, and resolving them efficiently. Its interface is optimized for responsiveness, ensuring a smooth experience on any device.

‚ú® Key Features
User Registration & Authentication: Secure login and signup managed through Firebase Authentication.

Ticket Submission: Users can describe their issues, set priority levels, and choose a category when raising tickets.

Admin panel:

View all tickets currently in the system.

(Coming soon) Assign tickets and update their statuses.

Ticket Tracking: Users can monitor the progress of their own tickets.

Theme Switcher: Light and dark mode options for better accessibility.

Intuitive UI: Designed with a modern, responsive look.

Cloud Database: All data is stored securely in Firebase Firestore.

üßë‚Äçüíª Technologies Utilized
React JS for the frontend.

Firebase Authentication for user management.

Firebase Firestore for cloud-based data storage.

Custom layouts using HTML and CSS.

Git and GitHub for version control.

üìå Planned Enhancements
Admin ticket assignment functionality.

Status updates for tickets (Open, In Progress, Resolved).

Comment threads for users and admins on tickets (messaging).

Admin analytics dashboard using Chart.js or Recharts.

Toast notifications to inform users of successful actions or errors.

React + Vite Template
The setup uses Vite for a quick and efficient React development environment, benefiting from Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint integration to enhance code quality.

Two recommended plugins include:

@vitejs/plugin-react, which leverages Babel for fast refresh capabilities.

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc, which employs SWC for accelerated fast refresh.

Expanding ESLint Configuration
To further refine code reliability in a production environment, it's suggested to adopt TypeScript with type-aware linting. Refer to the TypeScript template for guidance on integrating TypeScript and configuring eslint rules with typescript-eslint
